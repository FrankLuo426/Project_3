## How we met the Requirements/The Process

First, I make a broken game, but a whole structure, with no sound and not texture.

Then, John fixed the texture problem and make the game runnable again.

I make the sound and draw pixel art for texture.

John did the validation and background.

## What Went Right

Everything

## What Went Wrong

Nothing

## Possible Future Improvements

Nothing really, if anything I would spend more time improving the art a little, but it still looks pretty good.

## Anything Special?

You'll have to play the game to find out, but everything in the game is well done.
