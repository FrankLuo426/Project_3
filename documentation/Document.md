# The Fight of Keyboard Man!

# Proposal

## I. High Concept

- Survive as long as you can, by avoiding the dropping object.

## II. Genre

- Survive
- Avoidance

## III. Platform

Any platform with a browser and a keyboard.

## IV. Story

You are the light of justice, the hero of the internet, every net citizen is waiting for you to save them from toxic, cyberbully. You are the Keyboard Man! Your mission is to beat those who dare to challenge the safety of this wonderful internet.

## V. Esthetics

We will do a pixel or cartoon-style graphics.

Keyboard Man is a term to describe those people who just it in front of a computer and criticize others' shortcomings while doing nothing yourself. So our game will be going to use irony to express our philosophy.

## VI. Gameplay

### Mechanics

- You can move in 4 different kinds of direction. You need to avoid the good comment from the Top of the screen and punch those bad comments.

- Equipment system and equipment upgrade system.

- Skill system and skill tree.

### Control

Keyboard for playing and navigation

### New User Experience

Have a teaching style to tell how people can move.

### Player Learning

There is no way of actually beating the game. The goal is to survive as long as you can. As time pass, the speed of the game will raise. There will be more difficulty and more changeable stuff.

# Documentation

## How we met the Requirements/The Process

First, I make a broken game, but a whole structure, with no sound and not texture.

Then, John fixed the texture problem and make the game runnable again.

I make the sound and draw pixel art for texture.

John did the validation and background.

## What Went Right

Everything

## What Went Wrong

Nothing

## Possible Future Improvements

Nothing really, if anything I would spend more time improving the art a little, but it still looks pretty good.

## Anything Special?

You'll have to play the game to find out, but everything in the game is well done.
